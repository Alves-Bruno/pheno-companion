* Introduction

This is the companion repository for the paper entitled *Introducing a color correction method to reduce noise on plant phenology metrics*, by Bruno da Silva Alves, Bruna Alberton, Patricia Morellato and Lucas Mello Schnorr.

** Requirements
This companion material is written in the R programming language, and
all the scripts make heavy use of the [[https://www.tidyverse.org/][tidyverse]]. In order to reproduce
the work contained in this repository, both environments should be
installed. We also use the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorspace/vignettes/colorspace.html#installation][colorspace]] library for color palette
manipulation. The [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html][cowplot]] and [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html][patchwork]] libraries are used to combine
=ggplot= objects.

This work was tested in the following R environment:
